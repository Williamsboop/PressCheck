## pytesseract


This project uses [pytesseract](https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract) as a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine. You must have the Tesseract executable installed and available in your system PATH or specify its location in your code. For more information, see the [pytesseract documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/).

**Note:** The Tesseract-OCR Engine will be included in future releases of PressCheck for easier setup and use.
